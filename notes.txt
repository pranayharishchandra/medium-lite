Q -> why cloudwork it's called serverless
A -> whenever you deploy you application, it gets deployed in many mini machines. 
when you start start you application, it gets started everywhere

Q -> why prisma
A -> postgres doesn't support 1000s of connection, but in case of a serverless enviroment
many mini machine connects to postgres db, 
so in case of a serverless enviroment we will not directly connect to db
but will connect it through a "pool"

Q -> how prisma makes money
A -> gives you access to connection pool, caching, etc.

Q -> does prisma provides connection pool, if yes then does it mean that it's optional to use?

Q -> why we have to write real db in .env and not prisma (connection pool) DATABASE_URL
