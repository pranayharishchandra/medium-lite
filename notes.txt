-hono is similar to express
-express doesn't work well with - edge enviroments like cloudfare workers and other serverless functions
-hono is built to work on edge enviroments and other serverless functions
-hono is http framework

Q -> why cloudwork it's called serverless
A -> whenever you deploy you application, it gets deployed in many mini machines. 
when you start start you application, it gets started everywhere

Q -> why prisma
A -> postgres doesn't support 1000s of connection, but in case of a serverless enviroment
many mini machine connects to postgres db, 
so in case of a serverless enviroment we will not directly connect to db
but will connect it through a "pool"

Q -> how prisma makes money
A -> gives you access to connection pool, caching, etc.

Q -> does prisma provides connection pool, if yes then does it mean that it's optional to use?

Q -> why we have to write real db in .env and not prisma (connection pool) DATABASE_URL

Q -> npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema
A -> this command creates a "prisma/midgration" folder where your SQL commands to create the table is created.
When you run this command, Prisma will look at your Prisma schema file (usually named schema.prisma), compare it with the current state of the database, and generate a migration file if necessary to bring the database schema up to date with the schema defined in your Prisma schema file. The migration file will be named according to the provided --name flag, in this case, init_schema.

Q -> npx prisma generate --no-engine:
A -> allows you to generate the Prisma client code without relying on the Prisma Engine binaries, providing more flexibility in your development and deployment workflows.

Q -> what is "c" in "app.post('/api/v1/user/signup', (c) => {"
A -> "c" is called context, this has all the information like 
req, res, env variables

Q -> why we don't write in global context
A -> every route may be independently deployed, so may be the global execution don't run

NOTES:
-> commenting out the [vars] section in the wrangler.toml file will not cause any problems or make any difference in your Cloudflare Workers script's behavior.
